Graph
Node
Connection
Social Network
Entity
Person/User
Organization/Collage
Record

In the programming assignment :
Read the entity data (users/organizations) information from the file and create nodes in the social network
Add connection among the entities
Display the social network.
Print summaries of an entities (Person and Organizations should have different summaries )
Find entities in the network based on the name
Implement equals and hashCode of all the domain classes

Note :
1. Program flow is starting from SocialNetwork.java
2. There are two types of node in social network, i.e. User Node and Organisation Node.
3. There are two types of profiles, i.e., User Profile and Organisation Profile.
4. To valid various field in our network Validations.java plays the role.
5. FileReaderHandler and FileWriterHandler are used used to read connections and node and write connections and nodes respectively.
